### `npm run start`  

Runs the app.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  

## Packages I used 
 - **typescript**
 - **prop-types**
 - **node-sass**

## Process
First I added the different packages that I will need and created the main component to fetching data.<br>
Then I created a component Shop to displaying data.<br>
Finally I added Typescript and proptypes to avoid error at compilation and if the API data would change.
